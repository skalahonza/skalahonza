I started programming when I was at elementary school. It was more like block programming, a software called BaltÃ­k. I learned some basics: conditions, loops, coordinates, algorithms and stuff like that. Then I switched to C# and started doing desktop apps. When I started working in NETWORG I discovered a framework DotVVM. Through that I started experimenting with web apps. It really helped me to get around basics of web development without taking deep dives into JavaScript, which I did later anyway. Today I focus on creating web APIâ€™s or other backend services. I enjoy working with Azure and building cloud solutions, taking advantage of serverless solutions like Logic Apps or Azure Functions.

I am not just a tech guy. I also have passion for music. I play the piano in a band called JGDIX. I like jazz, swing and boogie-woogie. I love jam sessions and improvising. I have played since my early childhood.
